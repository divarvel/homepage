# Hi, I’m Clément

I'm a functional programmer working at Datadog. I love discussing about FP, distributed systems and cloud architecture.

## Talks

I have given a few talks at various conferences and meetups, mostly about functional programming: [Talks slides and videos](/talks)

## Free and Open Source Software

In my free time, I try to contribute to FOSS, especially on software I use daily. [My github page](https://github.com/divarvel) should give you an idea.

### Biscuit

I am a maintainer for (and project lead for) [Eclipse biscuit](https://biscuitsec.org).
